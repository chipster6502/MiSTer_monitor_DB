# ra_status.py — RetroAchievements status resolver for MiSTer Monitor (A5 live)
# =============================================================================
# Full version. Adds on top of the minimal one:
#   - hardcore breakdown (unlocked_hardcore / points_hardcore)
#   - LastGameID fallback with TITLE CORROBORATION for unindexed dumps and
#     CD systems (only trusted when RA's title matches the local search_name)
#   - background unlock polling thread (event_counter + last_unlock_* fields)
#
# A5 live layer (all optional — every tier degrades to the one below it):
#   - odelot debug-log tailer: with debug=1 in /media/fat/retroachievements.cfg
#     the fork writes /tmp/ra_debug.log; the tailer turns ACHIEVEMENT TRIGGERED
#     lines into instant events (<1 s, with title AND description, no cloud
#     roundtrip) and captures the rc_hash of every load ("ROM MD5"), which
#     resolves CD systems (PSX/Saturn/MegaCD) we cannot hash locally.
#     tmpfs RAM guard included — see the tailer section.
#   - OSD trigger: /tmp/OSD_VISIBLE (fork writes it when MiSTer.ini has
#     log_file_entry=1) debounces an immediate cloud poll, ~3-8 s latency
#     without needing debug=1.
#   - 60 s cloud poll: unchanged last-resort tier, now also woken on demand
#     by the two tiers above (and it backfills points/hardcore into
#     log-sourced events).
#   - get_ra_event(): ~60-byte payload for the firmware's 5 s micro-poll.
#   - get_ra_achievements(): flat paginated trophy list for the firmware
#     subpages, served from the rows the progress fetch already downloads
#     (zero extra RA API calls).
#
# Threading / coupling model:
#   The polling thread never imports the server module (that pattern loaded a
#   ghost second instance during bring-up). Instead the server injects a state
#   getter at startup:
#       from ra_status import start_ra_polling
#       start_ra_polling(lambda: (_state, _state_lock))
#   The getter is used ONLY to read _state['seq'] so the thread can detect
#   game changes; everything else flows through the normal endpoint path.
#
# Flat-JSON contract: every field is a scalar (string/int/bool). The CYD
# firmware parses with extractStringValue/extractIntValue/extractBoolValue —
# no nested objects, ever.
#
# UNVERIFIED field-name assumptions (flagged in PENDING.md):
#   - API_GetUserRecentAchievements entries: AchievementID, Title, Points,
#     Date, GameID, HardcoreMode, and the 'm' (minutes) request param.
#     A real live unlock (odelot fork) is needed to confirm.
#   - API_GetUserSummary: LastGameID field. Verifiable with curl.

    Two facts, checked in order:

      1. /media/fat/retroachievements.cfg — odelot's fork config. Without it
         the fork is not installed, and nothing can ever unlock whatever core
         is loaded.

      2. /tmp/ra_debug.log read as a HEARTBEAT rather than as a trace. The fork
         polls an adapted core about once per frame and writes a line each time
         ("A2600 poll=... frame=..."), so while one is running the file's mtime
         is never more than a moment old. A stock core writes nothing: the file
         does not exist at all before the session's first RA core, and it stops
         growing the moment you leave one. Freshness therefore answers "is an
         RA-adapted core running RIGHT NOW", and answers it identically for
         both installation routes — unlike the RA_ CORENAME prefix, which is
         added by MiSTer Companion's MGLs and is absent when the binaries come
         straight from odelot's forks (their CONF_STR name is the stock one).

    Returns False when the fork's config has no debug=1, since then there is no
    log to read at all. The firmware falls back to the CORENAME prefix in that
    case, which still covers every toolkit install; a direct install without
    debug=1 is the one blind spot, and enabling debug=1 closes it.

# =============================================================================
# With debug=1 in /media/fat/retroachievements.cfg the odelot fork writes
# /tmp/ra_debug.log (fopen "w" per RA-core start, fflush() after every line).
# The format anchors below are taken verbatim from the fork's achievements.cpp
# (the RA_LOG macro prefixes every line with "RA: "):
#     RA: *** ACHIEVEMENT TRIGGERED: [%u] %s \u2014 %s ***    (em dash U+2014)
#     RA: Hashing ROM: %s (%u bytes)
#     RA: ROM MD5: %s
#     RA: *** GAME COMPLETED! ***
# A debug log is NOT an API contract, so everything parses defensively and the
# OSD trigger + 60 s cloud poll stay underneath as fallback tiers: a format
# change in a future fork release degrades latency, never correctness.
#
# RAM safety: /tmp is tmpfs, and the WRITER (the fork) is what grows it — the
# per-session fopen("w") already bounds the file to one core session, and this
# tailer adds a guard on top: once the unconsumed region would exceed
# _LOG_GUARD_BYTES it punches a hole over the already-read bytes
# (fallocate PUNCH_HOLE|KEEP_SIZE — tmpfs frees those pages while the fork's
# non-O_APPEND fd keeps writing at its own offset, so neither side notices).
# Where hole punching is unavailable it falls back to truncate(0); the one-off
# re-read of the sparse gap is NUL-stripped and costs a single cheap pass.
# Net effect: enabling debug=1 with this server running is SAFER than enabling
# it bare, because the fork gains the log rotation it does not have.
